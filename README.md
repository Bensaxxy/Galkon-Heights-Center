## Getting Started
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Installation
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bensaxxy/Galkon-Heights-Center
    cd Galkon-Heights-Center
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Create Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following EmailJS credentials. You will need to obtain these from your EmailJS account.
    ```
    VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID="YOUR_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID"
    VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID="YOUR_EMAILJS_REQUEST_TEMPLATE_ID"
    VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY="YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY"
    ```
    _Note: The training enrollment form uses a specific template ID (`template_vlu21fj`) hardcoded in `src/pages/Training.jsx` in addition to the `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` used by the generic request form._
4.  **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port as indicated by Vite).

## Usage
Upon launching the application, you can navigate through various sections:

*   **Home Page (`/`)**: Discover an overview of Galkon Heights' services and popular offerings. Use the call-to-action buttons to quickly navigate to the request or training pages.
*   **Training Page (`/training`)**: Explore detailed descriptions of the Basic and Advanced Computer Training programs. Click "Enroll Now" to open a modal form where you can submit your details to sign up.
*   **Make a Request Page (`/request`)**: Fill out a form to submit a specific service request. Select the desired service and provide details, then submit to send an email to the business center.
*   **Contact Page (`/contact`)**: Find the physical address, phone number, email address, and a Google Map embed for the business center's location.

The navigation bar provides quick access to all main sections, and the footer contains essential contact and location information.
