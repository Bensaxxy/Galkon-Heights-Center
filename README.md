### Environment Variables

This project uses [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for sending service requests and training enrollment emails. You will need to configure your EmailJS credentials.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project:
    ```
    .env
    ```
2.  **Add the following variables** to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual EmailJS credentials:

    ```ini
    VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID="your_emailjs_service_id"
    VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID="your_emailjs_template_request_id"
    VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_TRAINING_ID="your_emailjs_template_training_id"
    VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY="your_emailjs_public_key"
    ```

    *   You can find your `SERVICE_ID`, `TEMPLATE_ID` (for service requests and training enrollments), and `PUBLIC_KEY` in your [EmailJS Dashboard](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/introduction/how-it-works/).

## Usage
